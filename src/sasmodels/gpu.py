"""
GPU support through OpenCL

There should be a single GPU environment running on the system.  This
environment is constructed on the first call to :func:`env`, and the
same environment is returned on each call.

After retrieving the environment, the next step is to create the kernel.
This is done with a call to :meth:`GpuEnvironment.make_kernel`, which
returns the type of data used by the kernel.

Next a :class:`GpuData` object should be created with the correct kind
of data.  This data object can be used by multiple kernels, for example,
if the target model is a weighted sum of multiple kernels.  The data
should include any extra evaluation points required to compute the proper
data smearing.  This need not match the square grid for 2D data if there
is an index saying which q points are active.

Together the GpuData, the program, and a device form a :class:`GpuKernel`.
This kernel is used during fitting, receiving new sets of parameters and
evaluating them.  The output value is stored in an output buffer on the
devices, where it can be combined with other structure factors and form
factors and have instrumental resolution effects applied.
